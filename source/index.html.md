# Introduction

Welcome to the Imdb Unofficial API! You can use our API to access Imdb content.
In examples we are using Symfony component called [The HttpClient Component](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_client.html).

# Authentication

> Pass your API-key in all API requests as a header. To authorize, use this code:

> Request:

```php
<?php
$api_key = YOURAPIKEY;
$query_parameters = QUERYPARAMETERS;
$host = YOURDOMAIN;

$httpClient = HttpClient::create([
    'headers' => ['X-AUTH-API' => $api_key, 'Referer' => $host],
]);

$response = $httpClient->request('GET', 'https://affwebgen.com/api', ['query' => $query_parameters,]);

?>
```


> Make sure to replace `YOURAPIKEY` with your API key,  `QUERYPARAMETERS` with parameters as it is defined in API and YOURDOMAIN with domainname from which you will make requests for example asdf.com.

Each project has different API key. Before making any request with your api key please be sure you configured allowed titles in [admin](https://affwebgen.com).

To make any request use api url: <code>https://affwebgen.com/api</code> and send us <code>GET</code> request.

<aside class="notice">
    You must replace <code>YOURAPIKEY</code> with your API key  and <code>YOURDOMAIN</code> with your domain name from your project in admin.

# Query Parameters
Query parameters are used to generated specific response. You can combine it in any way you want. Every response is JSON formated.

HUH?? Was I having a nightmare or was this dreck actually being broadcast?The show's entire content is made up of promo interviews provided by the studios, along with movie trailers, bad comics, and music videos. Between the cheesy music, the obsolete graphics, Allen as host, his wife(?)as producer, and the aforementioned filler, what's the budget...about $47.26 an episode?I somehow stumbled through the entire program and SWEAR that Allen said \"Comin' up neeeeext\" prior to every commercial break. Wasn't this guy a comedian at one point in his career? How about some original material, fella?? Anyway, if you want a belly laugh, stay with the show until the end credits and you will be rewarded with a can't miss REALLY bad edit as the music loop runs out. Maybe Byron does the sound editing as well to save a few more bucks?? This really IS syndicated programming at its worst. I'd prefer watching \"Conversation with Fred Lewis\" a 1980's infomercial for New Generation hair growth shampoo...",

HUH?? Was I having a nightmare or was this dreck actually being broadcast?The show's entire content is made up of promo interviews provided by the studios, along with movie trailers, bad comics, and music videos. Between the cheesy music, the obsolete graphics, Allen as host, his wife(?)as producer, and the aforementioned filler, what's the budget...about $47.26 an episode?I somehow stumbled through the entire program and SWEAR that Allen said \"Comin' up neeeeext\" prior to every commercial break. Wasn't this guy a comedian at one point in his career? How about some original material, fella?? Anyway, if you want a belly laugh, stay with the show until the end credits and you will be rewarded with a can't miss REALLY bad edit as the music loop runs out. Maybe Byron does the sound editing as well to save a few more bucks?? This really IS syndicated programming at its worst. I'd prefer watching \"Conversation with Fred Lewis\" a 1980's infomercial for New Generation hair growth shampoo...",
